	"overview":"Three brother bears awkwardly attempt to find their place in civilized  society, whether they're looking for food, trying to make human friends,  or scheming to become famous on the internet. Grizzly, Panda and Ice  Bear stack atop one another when they leave their cave and explore the  hipster environs of the San Francisco Bay Area, and it's clear the  siblings have a lot to learn about a technologically driven world. By  their side on many adventures are best friend Chloe (the only human  character in the cast), fame-obsessed panda Nom Nom, and Charlie, aka  Bigfoot.",
